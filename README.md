# CornellMystery
This is a text-based, Cornell-themed murder mystery game implemented in OCaml using modular coding.
It is a board-game where the player "rolls" dice and moves on the board to have different opportunities like
talking to some characters and asking questions and guess the murderer and the weapon.
The main game is composed of main.ml, state.ml and command.ml. There are mini-games added to the game 
to collect more points, which are called buildings.ml and hangman.ml.
